some notes..

ICMP4 has the type of 8 bit and code of 8 bit.
The packet is being rejected by a firewall:
I place full packets into a file named website.pcap
The file named website.pcap has all packet headers of ICMP and UDP.
When the packet was arrived at the destination, but there were one or two asterisks on
router, it does not mean that the packet was lost. Most firewall block ping or traceroute packets, to prevent routers from being attacks.
There are some reasons when it shows three asterisks at end of the
traceroute:
The firewall and other security device block and prevent my request to the destination
through using traceroute because the destination can be reached using a different
application such as using the browser.
It could be a connection problem and the destination could not be reached.
Surprise me: when the packet travels so far through a physical distance. The length of
the longest possible path traveled between two point.
These tools are useful when I need to test a website that is unreachable. I can find out where the connection fails.
It is a good idea to save a traceroute and tcpdump file of my website during it is working because when it fails or is unreachable, I can compare these files.
Even if the path passes different network but it would be similar.
Also if there was timed out after the first line, I would need to connect the company that provides internet services or the network admin because there was a problem
