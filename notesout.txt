Visual Trace Route is in the USA
I can trace from my location (proxy trace) or their location (host trace).
When there is an issue when I trace I think because it is buffering the data in memory 
du.ac.in before reached the destination, it goes from my computer through many comcast's
routers in several location in the USA, then travels to Switzerland then to England.
It travels through different ISPs regional internet registries (RIR) 
when I trace uba.ar it shows the domain is an invalid address because the top-level 
domain "ar" could not recognize on Visual Trace Route website.

traceroute is in Germany 
It shows when someone, who is from Germany, wants to access stevens.edu, 
First it goes to New York then Los Angeles before reached to the destination because the traffic travel through a global network from Europe to USA
du.ac.in is not reachable using this website. 
There is an issue when I trace uba.ar, I think because in the website there is buffering the data in memory
